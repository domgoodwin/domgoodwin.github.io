means you can define how the network traffic can get to your pod inside a kubernetes resource and a controller hosted in the cluster takes care of the implementation.\nin a world without kubernetes, you might have a reverse proxy deployed where you write the configuration file to detail how to expose your applications in the backend. an ingress controller takes that reverse proxy and automatically generates the config based on the ingress kubernetes resources you create. you don‚Äôt have to create a new loadbalancer service and cloud load balancer for each service you want to expose.\nin this guide, we‚Äôll use the kubernetes maintained ingress controller, ingress-nginx, which uses nginx as it‚Äôs reverse proxy. it‚Äôs important to note, this isn‚Äôt the nginx-ingress-controller from nginx themselves which has hooks into nginx plus and other paid offerings. the docs for ingress-nginx can be found here.\nü§∑ why not just loadbalancer? kubernetes provides a way for a cloud provisioned load balancer (an aws elastic load balancer for instance) to be deployed by the control plane, see my services post for more info. we can use these to expose a single service (and collection of pods) from a load balancer. but what happens when you have 50 services deployed onto your cluster? would you have 50 load balancers for them all? that‚Äôs ~$810 in standing charges every month not including paying for the traffic that goes through them.\nthis is where an ingress controller comes in. an ingress controller is a centralized place for traffic to enter your cluster via a single load balancer which then is routed to your backend services automatically. this is all based on ingress resources deployed on the cluster, through the reverse proxy. it also introduces a place to add some control over your traffic routing. kube-proxy will default (when in iptables mode) to tcp load balancing traffic randomly, the traffic coming in via a load balancer goes to any pods. with the controls you can configure affinities, round-robin routing, rate limits, cors etc. to really shape the traffic going to your pods centrally.\nthese diagrams compare the path a request would take with/without an ingress controller exposing your pod:\nwithout: application service loadbalancer ‚Üí nodeport ‚Üí randomly to one of your podswithout: application service loadbalancer ‚Üí nodeport ‚Üí randomly to one of your pods\nwith: ingress-controller service loadbalancer ‚Üí nodeport ‚Üí randomly to an ingress-controller pod ‚Üí to one of your application pods via clusteripwith: ingress-controller service loadbalancer ‚Üí nodeport ‚Üí randomly to an ingress-controller pod ‚Üí to one of your application pods via clusterip\nthere are some tradeoffs to using an ingress controller:\nthis introduces an extra hop for your network requests to reach your pod. if you have high throughput - and low latency is important - this could be a consideration in the same vein, the ingress controller pods also use resources. if you have the ingress controller doing a lot of tls termination or handling high load the resource usage will increase significantly you can only really use this for (mostly) layer 7 traffic, tcp or udp cannot directly be exposed this way üõ†Ô∏è so what does an ingress controller actually do? at a high level you have the following components:\nkubernetes resources: service: type loadbalancer, meaning your ingress-controller pods are fronted by a cloud load balancer and exposed outside the cluster deployment: ingress controller itself (see components below for a breakdown) (sometimes)deployment: default backend, this is where the ingress controller routes traffic to when there isn‚Äôt a matching host/path rule for the traffic coming in components of the ingress controller: reverse proxy: this is what actually routes the traffic coming in to downstream services/pods. if you installed nginx on a service and ran it it‚Äôs this basically config generator: this continuously gets the state of ingress resources in the kubernetes cluster (think of it as spamming kubectl get ingress -a every x-seconds) and uses that to generate config that the reverse proxy (nginx in this case) understands the reverse proxy continually has it‚Äôs config updated by the config generator and then traffic coming into the cluster via the loadbalancer service hits the reverse proxy and is routed to the proper backend service/pods.\nüîí what about ssl? for https traffic, we can configure the ingress-controller to terminate the ssl and provide the certs as needed.\nwhen creating an ingress resource you can specify a kubernetes secret of type tls and the ingress-controller will use that secret to terminate the ssl of the request at the reverse proxy.\nthis could also be coupled with a tool like cert-manager to dynamically issue and renew certificates for you.\nüéõÔ∏è load balancer/reverse proxy controls as mentioned before, by having your pods traffic route via a reverse proxy in the cluster you gain more control over the routing and connection. some useful examples for ingress-nginx are:\nauthentication: setup basic or digest access authentication on routes nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic session affinity: allows for things like sticky sessions, keeping a user going to the same backend pod or use cookie affinity to apply a samesite sticky cookie nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: sticky ssl passthrough: instead of terminating tls at the load balancer you can let the backend handle it directly nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; redirections: both permanent and temporary nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect: https://www.google.com security controls ssl ciphers can be configured controlling which ssl ciphers you support nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-ciphers: \u0026quot;all:!anull:!export56:rc4+rsa:+high:+medium:+low:+sslv2:+exp\u0026quot; cors rules to configure the cross-original resource sharing rules nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; a lot of these controls can be configured either as annotations directly on ingress resources affecting only those specific routes, or can be provided in the configmap to be applied at a global level.\nü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è can i have multiple ingress-controllers? yes. let‚Äôs say you want to be able to accept traffic from the public internet as well as internally from inside your private network.\nwe would:\ndeploy two sets of ingress-controllers, ingress-public and ingress-private configure them to be public and private. this is done usually by the annotations given to the different service resources (service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: \u0026quot;internet-facing\u0026quot; for instance) setup the ingress classes this is a relatively new resource, it used to be managed by an annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class which is being deprecated when creating ingress resources you can target the ingressclass to specify which controller should setup routing for your traffic üìÆ what about hostnames? ingress resources in kubernetes allow you to specify both the paths and the host values to route traffic for.\nto have your ingress controller exposed via a friendly dns address you‚Äôd need to point a record of one to your load balancers dns address. in aws, this would be creating a route53 a record aliased to your elbs address. this would mean anything going to friendly-address.domain.com would point to your cloud-provisioned elb and then onto your reverse proxy pods from there.\nthen any routes off this hostname would be directed to your specified pods, ie.:\n`friendly-address.domain.com/app-a` ‚Üí `svc/app-a` in the cluster `friendly-address.domain.com/app-b` ‚Üí `svc/app-b` in the cluster and so on but what if you wanted to have multiple different hostnames, maybe 1 per application.\n`app-a.friendly-address.domain.com/` ‚Üí `svc/app-a` `app-b.friendly-address.domain.com/` ‚Üí `svc/app-b` these would mean adding a new route53 entry manually every time you want to deploy a new application. it takes away from the benefits of defining ingress as a kubernetes resource if you need to go click-ops or terraform a new host each time.\nthat‚Äôs where a tool like external-dns comes in.\nexternal-dns external-dns allows you to automatically configure your dns services based on your kubernetes ingress resources (and services!).\nas an example, if you have deployed external-dns and wanted to setup a new app-c.friendly-address.domain.com to point to your service all you would need to do is create an ingress resource with the host field set to app-c.friendly-address.domain.com and external-dns would provision you an a record pointing to your load balancer.\nüçµ bringing it all together to give an example of all of this in use, lets build resources for the following requirements:\nwe have 3 applications: alpha beta and gamma running on our cluster we want alpha and beta exposed via the same hostname but with separate routes: public.example.com/alpha and public.example.com/beta we want gamma to have it‚Äôs own hostname as it‚Äôs a separate, unrelated application gamma.public.example.com we have the tls key and cert for public.example.com and want the ingress-controller to terminate tls for this host gamma handles it‚Äôs own tls so we shouldn‚Äôt terminate it at the reverse proxy, we already have:\na kubernetes cluster running in aws deployed external-dns onto our cluster configured for aws route 53, [link] deployed ingress-nginx onto our cluster configured for aws, [link]. ingress class is set to default feel free to try these steps above for yourself the implementation and breakdown of what we‚Äôre doing come below though so spoiler alert.\ncreate the tls secret for our alpha/beta endpoint\nkubectl create secret tls public \\ --cert=tls.cert \\ --key=tls.key yaml for the ingress of alpha and beta\napiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: ingress metadata: name: alpha-beta spec:

shows the default backend detects gamma: adds nginx config to route to the services again, can be checked with: kubectl exec -it \u0026lt;ingress-controller-pod-name\u0026gt; -- cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf this config will show the ssl_passthrough is set to not handle any tls updates the ingress resource address field with the dns of the cloud load balancer that the controller knows is pointing at it. curl https://gamma.public.example.com -v shows traffic routing correctly and with our in-application tls handling external-dns: constantly checking for new/updated ingress resources sees the two new resources but with empty address fields - needs these to be set before it can point the specified host to the address the service sits behind. address field is now updated for alpha-beta: checks if the hostname has already been created external-dns defaults to using txt records in the chosen dns service to persist information about the domains it manages creates an a record pointing public.example.com to the value of address in the ingress address field is now updated for gamma this does the same as alpha-beta but for gamma.public.example.com ü¶¶ other controllers are available other ingress controllers are available too, notable/interesting ones include:\naws load balancer controller can manage albs out of cluster for ingress resources and nlbs for service resources traefix ingress controller an ingress controller using the kubernetes native edge router ambassador uses envoy to act as an ingress controller and api gateway the benefit of having all of your configuration directly in kubernetes as an ingress resource comes from every compliant ingress-controllers reading and interacting with ingress in the same way. the only change between them would be the implementation specific things you control via annotations, the general routes and hosts work regardless of your choice.\n","title":"Kubernetes Networking #3:

components will get that request to the right pod(s). how does a service know which pods it can talk to?\nselectors services map to pods via label selectors. you have a pod with label app=etizer and then create a service with .spec.selector for the same and that service will forward traffic to any ready pods matching that label.\nbehind the scenes, a service resource also creates an endpoints resource which maintains a list of pod ips based on your service selector. it‚Äôs worth noting here, the readyiness checks you implement for your pods are what controls whether the ip goes into this endpoints resource and allow traffic.\nthe exception here is selector-less services, these don‚Äôt have a label selector so won‚Äôt also have an endpoint resource. to use these you also need to create an endpoint resource of the same name as your service, you can add any ips and ports you want to this resource. this is a great way to map a service to something not in your cluster so your pods can

ip for the service this is within the --service-cluster-ip-range your api-server has been configured with kube-proxy is responsible for this virtual ip routing to one of your pod ips this virtual ip will forward requests to one of your pod ips based on the endpoints resource associated with your service. a local cluster dns address, eg. \u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;.svc.cluster.local this is resolved by your kube-dns (coredns) to your virtual service ip this is why your service name must be rfc 1035 compliant the normal way of utilising this would be giving your application the service dns address so it can talk to another application running on the cluster. this dns address resolves to the virtual ip and then the configuration kube-proxy controls handles that ip resolving to actual pod ip addresses. from there your cni will route your request using the pod ip.\nthe clusterip service type is ‚ú®special‚ú®, whilst you use it as a way to expose your service internally within the cluster, it‚Äôs also used by types nodeport and loadbalancer (by extension of loadbalancer using nodeport) as part of their implementations.\njust like a matryoshka dolljust like a matryoshka doll\n\u0026lt;service-ip\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;service-port\u0026gt; ‚Üí

address.\nthe port range defaults to 30000-32767, interestingly enough just below the linux kernel default ephemeral port range. it can also be configured with the flag --service-node-port-range if you need these ports for some use case.\nat a high level a nodeport is a single rule configured by kube-proxy onto every node, to forward requests to an underlying clusterip

loadbalancer type service only really works in a cloud environment. when created, asyncronously, the cloud-controller-manager will provision you a load balancer which directs traffic to your pods.\nthe implementation of the different cloud load balancers varys wildly. it used to be different clouds were implemented in-tree, committing directly to kubernetes but now it must be done via out-of-tree implementations, eg. cloud-provider-aws.\ncloud implementations aside, once you have a cloud load balancer it works by pointing to a nodeport service running. this means that you have a load balancer with every kubernetes worker node as a listener, forwarding traffic to any nodes on a particular port. from there it follows the standard nodeport ‚Üí clusterip route.\nif you didn‚Äôt want to write a whole cloud control manager to expose your application on your own servers, a nodeport service with that port pointed to from your existing load balancer would do the trick.\n\u0026lt;load-balancer-ip\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;lb-port\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; \u0026lt;node-ip\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;node-port\u0026gt; ‚Üí \u0026lt;service-ip\u0026gt;:service-port\u0026gt; ‚Üí \u0026lt;pod-ip\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;pod-port\u0026gt;\nexternalname externalname services are the odd one out. instead of using good ol‚Äô clusterip and getting a virtual ip, they create a cname record to map your service dns to another dns address.\nas an example use case, lets say you have different environment databases, instead of service-owners changing the dns depending on where they deploy their pods to you create a externalname service:\napiversion: v1 kind: service metadata: name: database namespace: prod spec: type: externalname externalname: prod.database.example.com --- apiversion: v1 kind: service metadata: name: database namespace: dev spec: type: externalname externalname: dev.database.example.com now all the service-owners have to do is point their code to database.svc.cluster.local and they will talk to the right database every time.\ndatabase.svc.cluster.local = cname test.database.example.com\nit‚Äôs worth noting since the pod requesting the service will get the cname record back, the pod also has to be configured to resolve whatever domain the cname returns. if it‚Äôs a private record, you might want to configure revolvers in coredns.\nhow virtual ips work most services (sorry, externalname) use a virtual ip to forward requests to the proper pods. it‚Äôs the responsibility of kube-proxy to provide this virtual ip and make sure the traffic is actually forwarded. kube-proxy runs on every node so the steps below happen per worker node.\nhow this works depends on the mode of kube-proxy is given with -proxy-mode flag:\n‚ÑπÔ∏è for all of these kube-proxy will monitor the control plane for new/updated/removed service and endpoint resources and run the following steps\nuserspace (legacy) for each service it opens a random proxy port on the node this proxy port is then told to iptables to capture traffic to this particular virtual ip and port to redirect to the pod ips in the endpoint resource the backend pod is chosen based on the sessionaffinity of the service the traffic here is actually proxied via kube-proxy itself iptables for each service it creates iptables rules which redirect traffic to the virtual ip and service port these redirect rules point to sets of pod ips based on what is in the endpoint resource the backend pod is chosen at random by default the traffic is all handled within the linux netfilter so all within the kernelspace, kube-proxy doesn‚Äôt handle the traffic it just sets up rules to process it ipvs whilst iptables was designed to be a firewall and kube-proxy just uses it to redirect network traffic, ipvs was made for load balancing at a high level this works similar to iptables, cluster ip and port ‚Üí set of pod ips ipvs is important when working at scale, if you have \u0026gt;1000 services (or 10,000 pods) in your cluster ipvs is the performant choice kernelspace (windows) bringing it all together let‚Äôs create an example loadbalancer service and see what components come together to get traffic from a client to your pods. we‚Äôll show how traffic from outside, via the load balancer, gets to your pods and how another pod in the cluster can also use this service without going via the load balancer.\nin this example let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre running on a kubernetes cluster in aws with the aws cloud controller manager properly configured, we have pods running with label app=alpha which listens on port 8080 for traffic and kube-proxy is in the default iptables mode.\nservice yaml\napiversion: v1 kind: service metadata: # this doesn\u0026#39;t affect routing but it\u0026#39;s best practice to label components together labels: app: alpha name: example spec: ports: - name: main port: 8081 protocol: tcp # target port is the port your pod has open targetport: 8080 # this is what tells the service which pods to route to selector: app: alpha type: loadbalancer lets create the service and have a look:\n$ kubectl apply -f service.yaml service/example created $ kubectl get service example name type cluster-ip external-ip port(s) age example loadbalancer 10.43.205.153 192.168.0.147 8081:32255/tcp 4s i now have:\nan endpoints resource corresponding to ready pods matching my label selector kubectl get endpoints example a cluster ip setup for my service 10.43.205.153 a dns address for the service configured (from inside a pod) dig example.default.svc.cluster.local a external (to the cluster) ip which maps to my load balancer 192.168.0.147 a nodeport setup 32255 so all my workers now have this port open netstat -tulnp | grep 32255 iptables rules setup sudo iptables -l | grep example sudo iptables -l | grep 10.43.205.153 lets see how this request goes through to our pod from outside the cluster and a pod within.\nfrom outside the cluster the client makes a request to the load balancer to try and talk to the application, for how this is configured see my post on ingress into a cluster the load balancer selects one of the configured listeners, this is usually either random or round robin but depends on your load balancer and configuration the node has port 32255 open, requests here are configured in iptables to forward the request to the virtual ip of the service. these rules were configured by kube-proxy iptables then resolves the virtual/service ip into a pod ip address, one is chosen by random and the request heads there. now the traffic is inside the cluster the cni controls the network movements between nodes (see here for more info on what the cni sets up) once the request has reached the node with the pod on it, the cni and iptables will forward it to the pod as expected from a pod within the cluster the requesting pod will have been configured with the service dns address example.default.svc.cluster.local. as it makes this request from within the cluster coredns running will be the dns resolver. this request will be resolved to the service (virtual) ip address: 10.43.205.153 making a request to this address will hit the rules in iptables, configured by kube-proxy, this resolves the service ip into a pod ip by randomly selecting a pod the rest of the request continues as in the external example.

in minutes before your shift ended. due to these, and many more, if you suggest to someone to start tracking their time they‚Äôre likely to look at you like you‚Äôve gone mad.\ni think time tracking, for your own benefit, can be a great way to be introspective about how you work and allow you a greater understanding of managing distractions, context switching and when you‚Äôre feeling productive.\nwhat is time tracking the basic gist is, you start a timer when you are working on something. whilst you could track time per ticket or some other fine grained metric, i would strongly recommend tracking categories of activities.\nones i track are:\ndevelopment - directly coding, usually ‚Äúwhen i‚Äôm in my ide‚Äù live support - picking up alerts that have fired or investigating issues/incidents messaging - slack messaging people meetings - time spent in any meetings i found it in the past useful to tag these ‚Äúceremonies‚Äù, ‚Äú1-1s‚Äù, ‚Äúother‚Äù break - going to grab a coffee or lunch this one could be tracked by just not running a timer, but i find ending the break timer when i return is a useful trigger to start working collaboration - working with someone else to either plan, pair or debug these activities can also be expanded with tags if you want to know more detail, things like whether the activity is for client a or b can be useful if that fits your environment.\ni‚Äôve also found adding activities when you want to focus on a particular area, say ‚Äúdocumentation‚Äù or ‚Äúreading tech books‚Äù can help you focus energy towards a goal.\na key thing with the tracking is not being too detailed, it‚Äôs not useful to know ticket-12 took twice as long as ticket-14 in the scheme of things (even if toggl do like to push jira integration). you‚Äôre not billing people for this time, it‚Äôs just about gaining understanding.\nhow to time track this might seem like an obvious area ‚Äúset timer to start when you work on something‚Äù but there‚Äôs some nuance and tips i can share.\nif at any point you stop working on your current task for distractions, stop said timer (and set a new one if applicable) a common thing might be you need to respond to someones message, ideally you try to batch these where possible and the people messaging you don‚Äôt just say hi, so maybe after 30minutes, stop the timer, start the messaging timer and respond to people before you begin any activity, start the timer i find this is a useful way of getting in the mindset for that task too, it forces you to mentally think ‚Äúwhat am i working on right now‚Äù instead of just falling into work you can always update past timers if you forget too, don‚Äôt try to be too accurate, to the nearest 5 minutes should show you the gist of it. ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt this add to the context switching load?‚Äù yes i believe it does, but that isn‚Äôt a problem. it should be harder for you to switch what task you‚Äôre working on to avoid (where possible) context switching and having to recognize you‚Äôre doing it, stop and start a timer, adds to the overhead, it‚Äôs way too easy to down tools on work to respond to slack. what time tracking is not it‚Äôs important to call out what personal time tracking is not, and avoid some of the pitfalls.\ntime tracking should be for your own benefit, and you should be the only one who sees the data. you‚Äôre not doing this to prove to your manager at year-end reviews you keep working even when you sneeze or to compare to your team. on the other side, this shouldn‚Äôt be something a manager imposes on you and wants to see progress reports. related to above, it‚Äôs important to be honest when time tracking. everyone has bad days for productivity and just leaving ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù timer on won‚Äôt help you understand anything. this timer is just meant to be data on how you work, no opinions or judgement. benefits of time tracking i‚Äôve personally found tracking my time, even for short 1 month stints, a great way to introspect on your working habits.\na good example is at the end of the day, when you might be feeling like it was (or wasn‚Äôt) a productive day. being able to look back and go ‚Äúoh, those 4 meetings 30minutes apart basically translated to 4hrs of meetings for my productivity‚Äù. i‚Äôve commonly found days when i‚Äôm feeling unproductive, i can look at my time tracked for the day and understand why.\nanother key aspect is seeing the effect interrupts have on you, everyone knows the bane of context switching at this point, but being able to see the switch in activity and then the lull between starting anew is clear.\ni‚Äôve also found having to think about starting a task, having a timer to start when i go into development mode helps mentally adjust to the task at hand.\ntools and use and how to set them up for actually tracking the time, i use: toggl track. honestly, i don‚Äôt particularly like it but i haven‚Äôt found an alternative that does everything i need and don\u0026rsquo;t need to install.\ni‚Äôve previous used timery, which makes it easier to change timer and highly recommend it to never interact with toggl. i would highly recommend this when you can install applications on your own machine and for ios if you have it.\ni have a pinned tab open in my browser with toggl, it goes grey when there isn‚Äôt one active which i find useful timery will sit in the top bar of my mac which makes using it easier i then setup a widget on my phone home screen. this helps me spot any timers i‚Äôve left running. within toggl, i have the activities i listed above as ‚Äúprojects‚Äù. i don‚Äôt use any tags currently but i‚Äôve found it useful in the past when working across teams or clients.\na good rule is a project should be something important to you but broad enough you don‚Äôt need to think or decide which one to use when starting a timer. it should be obvious what the work you‚Äôre doing is. as an example for tags, i wanted to see which client‚Äôs live issues were taking the most time in my day. to round up time tracking can be a useful tool to gain insight into your working habits and productivity. i‚Äôd recommend only doing it when you‚Äôre gaining something from it; in the past i‚Äôve used it for 1-3month stints when feeling unproductive or joining a new company. if you‚Äôre doing it and finding the data not useful.\n","title":"The case for time-tracking"},{"date":"2022-01-10","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://dgood.win/posts/kubernetes-networking-overview/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eKubernetes

can be a bit of a rabbit hole to debug and discover what your pods are actually doing. in this post we‚Äôll explore at a high level how a request goes from 1 pod to another and which components control each.\ncomponents the components we‚Äôre going to look at today are:\nkube-dns/coredns resolves domain names for services (and pods) into an ip address ‚ÑπÔ∏è kube-dns was replaced by coredns but the in cluster service is still called kube-dns this is the resolver for any dns requests inside your pods, if you wanted to resolve internal service domains or to a private dns resolver, you could configure this to forward those requests. kube-proxy resolves network requests for the ip address of a service to the ip addresses of pods which match that service. this has different modes: iptables (default) - to see your iptables rules: iptables -l ipvs - to see your ipvs rules ipvsadm -ln your chosen cni, there‚Äôs a range of these, all which work differently. generally a cni will configure any networking around a pod ip, routing to and from pods to: ensure pod network requests are routed properly to other pods ensure pod network requests can reach outside the cluster an easy way of thinking about it can be, resolving between a service and healthy pods is kube-dns and kube-proxy but then that request will need to go through routing setup by the cni. for cloud environments, your cni will usually handle (or provide ways to setup) things like cross-subnet traffic as well.\nto follow the resolution between components, say we wanted to go to a service called myapp which sits in namespace namespace001 which had 2 healthy pods matching the service selector. the resolution would be:\ncoredns: (service fqdn)myapp.namespace001.svc.cluster.local ‚Üí 172.16.10.10 (service cluster ip) iptables: 172.16.10.10 ‚Üí 10.10.10.10 (a pod ip, selected at random from healthy pods) cni: will route traffic for 10.10.10.10 from the requester node, to the target node example journey of a request as an example, let‚Äôs explore in an example kubernetes cluster how a pod will send a network request to another pod. for this example:\nthe pod will try to talk to a pod on another node then itself the 2 nodes will be in seperate subnets routing between subnets is presumed to be setup and fine and we‚Äôll abstract that to a router in the diagram the cni will be calico, but we won‚Äôt be looking too much into its internals pod-0 will send a request to pod-3 through a service we‚Äôll assume kubernetes and calico are setup with defaults: iptables mode for kube-proxy vxlan encapsulation for cross subnet traffic 1 pod-0 requests the service‚Äôs cluster ip from kube-dns\nkube-dns has dynamic config which updates mapping the service name to a service ip address lets say 172.16.10.10 `kubectl exec command for coredns *technically this whole request to kube-dns goes via the same iptables‚Üírouting tables path since kube-dns runs in pods on the cluster. the only key difference is the dns resolver is an ip address so it doesn‚Äôt ask kube-dns to define kube-dns. but trying to show aswell would be madness. 2 with the cluster ip (172.16.10.10) the request hits iptables\niptables selects from a random one of the pod ip addresses for this particular service ip iptables -l or iptables-save these rules are all loaded in here and dynamically updated by `kube-proxy if a pod starts failing readiness checks for instance, it gets removed from this list. 3 the pod ip is now resolved in the nodes routing tables sudo route -n or ip route list\nthese routing table rules will be configured based on the network environment the node sits in. calico, running locally, will also configure rules for pod networking. based on the pod ip, it‚Äôll be resolved through multiple sets of rules: this node will have a range of pod ips which resolve to the local node itself this node will also have an ip range for nodes inside the same subnet - these could avoid encapsulation for performance gain this node also has range(s) for other subnets, if it‚Äôs not local to the node or subnet, it then gets routed to the subnet routing table. for these rules, calico might instead route traffic to itself to be encapsulated before crossing the network boundary. there also might be a range for external traffic not local to the network, but if this was a private subnet this is most likely behind a nat gateway inside the local network this particular request is destined for another subnet. the routing table has directed the request to the calico pod running locally on this node to handle routing this. 4 calico will now encapsulate the network request to allow it to pass subnet boundaries calicoctl node status\nby encapsulating the request‚Äôs original networking information is wrapped up as data and new network info is added calico will send this as a vxlan or ipinip packet to the required node in another subnet the encapsulated packet (shown as an orange line) will: go back through the route table on the node itself to the local subnet router, which will resolve which subnet it needs to go into hit the destination subnet routing table which can direct it to the node to the other node itself 5 once the encapsulted packet arrived at the other node, it‚Äôll go through iptables rules to see if it‚Äôs allowed traffic.\nthis is why you might need to add the encapsulated packets into your firewall rules to be allowed in. 6 the routing table on this node will now:\nsend the encapsulated packet to the local calico to be unencapsulated the original (unencapsulated) network request will resolve again in iptables and routing tables rules to determine where it should go this could also cause the packet to have to be routed again since the destination has moved the request is directed to the pod running locally there are a lot of things missed off here: technically iptables is interacted with before, after (and sometimes during) a routing decision how the pod sits within it‚Äôs own network namespace with a virtual ethernet interface for traffic coming to the pod how calico uses felix to program it‚Äôs routes and acls and bird for distributing the routes to bgp peers on the network alternate cnis how the whole kube-proxy aspects could be stipped out for an ebpf approach (calico‚Äôs ebpf dataplane or cilium and it‚Äôs kube proxy replacement) related docs: calico component architecture kube-proxy reference kubernetes dns docs ","title":"Kubernetes Networking
